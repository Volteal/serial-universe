# Chapter One: Rough Awakening

Amid the ruins of the City of Kronsburg lay a feminine figure wrapped in a desert cloak and stained with a gray sludge. The buildings around her all reduced to unrecognizable rubble. The immediate ground around her stained with the same dark gray sludge that coated her. The air around her was filled with dust and the flurry of blue-ish white ash. Had it not been for the utter destruction of the city around her, it might have looked like the start of winter.

Her eyes snapped open in a panic. Unable to focus on a single thing the woman's long ears perked up to listen. The distant howl of wind, sirens, and the screams. Struggling to remember what happened before she woke up all she could remember were those horrible sirens, the screams of fear, a flash of heat and then darkness. Now her ears were greeted with the horrifying, banshee like wails of the dying. Attempting to struggle onto her feet she almost immediately fell back down on the ground, a scream of ripping form her throat. The mere act of trying to stand up was agony.

Laying face down on the shattered cobblestone road she steeled herself and slowly, carefully pushed herself up sit on her knees. By sheer force of will she pushed the intense searing pain aside, the pain made it hard for her to breath. Grabbing for her backpack and pulling it closer. Ripping open the front pouch she took the syringe and stabbed it into her side, easing the pain with the medication.

"Goddess, FUCK." The woman screamed as she felt the medicine ease the pain and as a result her breathing. Finally able to focus on more than just herself she looked around what had once been a beautiful city. She couldn't place where she was as she cast her gaze around the area. The city transformed beyond recognition. Shaking her head lightly she focused on searching for the castle.

A gasp slipped free. She stared wide eyed at the hill where the castle would have been, except there was no hill, and no castle. Just a sickeningly blue simmer in the air. "No...." She muttered to herself. She could taste the magic in the air, the air around her was virtually buzzing with it. "Calm down Mira, Calm. Down." She told herself but it did little to help the panic rising inside of her.

A groan caught her attention. She turned to look at a figure approaching from around the rubble. The darkness made it hard to make out the person heading her way but she could see they needed medical attention. The person was limping and groaning in pain. Mira got to her feet and grabbed her pack rushing at the person. "Hello? Are you alright? Do you need medical attention?" She asked. This was the first sign of life she had seen since waking up.

The scent was the first thing that caught her attention. The unmistakable aroma of diseased flesh. She halted in her sprint for a moment. The person started moving at her faster, but did not answer. No, they went to a dead sprint at her giving Mira no time to dodge or move as she was bowled over. Slamming into the ground, hard, she screamed as she was confronted by the half burnt face of what she assumed had once been a human man. His flesh barely held to his body, part of it almost oozing off down his neck and chest.

Mira managed to push the man back, barely avoiding the bite aimed to her throat. Panic set in as she tried, and struggled to push him off. His frenzied biting making it impossible for her to do much else than push to keep him at bay. Desperately looking around she lashed out, grabbing the closest brick and slamming it into the man's head. The sickening crack of a skull shattering, followed by his feral scream gave her the chance to roll away.

Putting distance between the two of them Mira scooped up her rifle, turning around to unload the weapon into him. The sharp crack echoing through the ruined street. She watched as he dropped to the ground. But even after an entire clip he was still moving. Her long ears perked as she heard the distant groans. Two? Thee? No, more. Running to her bag she grabbed it and ran.

She jumped up the rubble. Getting the high ground on what had once been a tavern's second story. Though most of it had caved into the first floor. Crouching behind a corner she leveled her weapon and brought her eye to her scope. To her horror she watched as the man struggled to his feet. The wounds she had caused leaking a tar like substance down his form.

More of them, more people rushed into the area where she had woken up. To her horror she watched men, women, and children all reduced to feral monsters. Taking a deep breath she lowered her weapon. "Goddess, have mercy." She muttered. Leaning back against the wall she laid her weapon down and pushed her hair from her face.

"What is going on here..." she muttered to herself.
